# Penguin Data Analysis

Dataset: penguins_size.csv 

Predictive approach of ML was used to determine the class of penguin species. Two different ratios (60-20-20 & 80-10-10) of training, validation and test data were used to determine the performance of the models. Hyperparameter tuning was performed on SVM, LR and RF algorithms. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and latency were used to compare the performance.
