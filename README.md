Exploratory data analysis is performed on the Penguin dataset (penguins_size.csv). The two split ratios of training, validation and test: 80-10-10 and 60-20-20 are used for analyzing the dataset. Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest algorithms are used to implement GridSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters.
